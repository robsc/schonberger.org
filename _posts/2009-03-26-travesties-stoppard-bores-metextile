title: Travesties @ The Drama Theatre
---

p(meta). 26 March, half asleep in a play.

Tom Stoppard. Goodness. a big name in theatre if ever there is one, and the stc is putting on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travesties">Travesties</a> at the Opera House. You'd think it would be really interesting, but my goodnesss, I haven't been bored like that in a play in years and years.

Travesties is meant to be a bit of a funny play about Zurich in 1917, bringing together James Joyce, Valdimir Lenin & the Dadaist artist Tristian Tzara on screen at the same time, all told through the eyes of the then Britich Consul to Switzerland.
