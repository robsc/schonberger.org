title: The hardest part of writing is &hellip;

p(meta). At work, lunch break.

How on earth do authors do it. I find it so hard to just write about something interesting frequently enough; And eloquently enough to be able to proudly put a little authors tag on the page. I guess this is a well known problem, hence the phrase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer's_block">writer's block</a>. So what do people try to do against it? 

I recently read an inspiring memoir by Haruki Murakami, titled 'What I talk about when I talk about running' . Of course, as you'd expect, but really, how some of the same psychological forces are at play in other parts of his life. Most notably, <i>discipline</i>. Haruki knows that in order to run marathons, he must run a certain training distance every month; Thats OK. He claims to approach writing in the same way: To be disciplined, and to write, no matter what, between 9 and 2 every day. Thats it. 

Well, of course, thats not it, but the point is there. I think I'm going to do the same. So from now, expect a 15 minute effort per day in writing something, about something interesting. If you've got topics, then please. Although, it could be something else; I have another blog project coming up (very exciting!) and that could steal me a little. See? there goes the discipline. 

OK, 15 minutes. Every day. 1 month. Deal.
