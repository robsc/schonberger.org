title: Spam, it's not all bad.
---
p(meta). December 10. It's raining and cold.

People always complain about spam. And there are hundreds, if not thousands of people I know who work on trying to get it out, as well as probably the same, if not more, who work hard to make it.

If you get spammed, get annoyed, but before you do, get happy. It means that you're worth something. If someone is taking the time to try and take your traffic away from you, for whatever money making reason, you're worth something. Be happy about it. 

Then get mad and get even. Smile first.
