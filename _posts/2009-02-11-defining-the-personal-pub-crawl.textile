title: Defining the 'Personal Pub Crawl'
---

p(meta). 11 Feb 2009

Many of you are familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_Crawl">Pub Crawl</a>, otherwise known as the Bar Hop, Bar Tour, and so forth. After having a chat to a friend the other day i'd like to define what is to be known as <cite>The Personal Pub Crawl</cite>. 

I spoke to this friend, and it turned out that he was going to have a night after work where, in quick succession: 
<ol><li>Would have a drink with a friend at a pub near work.
<li>Go for drinks with people from work.
<li>Go for drinks with another friend in another part of town.
<li>Go for a friendly drink at a restaurant for someone who is going to get married
</ol>

All in the space of something like 4 hours, on a weeknight. It occurred to me that this is in fact a personal pub crawl. What else could it really be?
