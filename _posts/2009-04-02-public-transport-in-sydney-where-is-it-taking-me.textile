p(meta). April Serious day (the 2nd)

Public transport in Sydney is really light years ahead of some places in the world. Places like Palo Alto, Mukinupin and alice springs would dream of having a system as good. Me? I'm just dreaming of a system that works, and i'm astounded by the number of missteps that Sydneys public transport is making. 

My faivorate is some of the fun that Sydney Ferries has been giving me. It's by far the nicest way of getting anywhere in this city, catching a small harbour peaceful harbour cruise to get to work. But apparantely, the best way to make the ferry system is put it into private hands, according to its current management, is to sell and privatise it. Great idea to privatise, see how well it worked for the Cross City Tunnel? All that would happen is that the ferries would turn into their own super expensive toll network, and be a useless little trinket on our harbor, but when you do need one, they'd cost an arm and a leg. One of the thigns that makes networks like New York, San Francisco and Melbourne 'tick' is the ubiquity o a ticket. In Melbourne, a ticket will take you anywhere in town, as many trips as you'd like, within a 2 hour period. The smae goes in San Francisco. All that creating a separate network does is make commuters lives more difficult by having to pay several fiefdoms that don't want to talk to each other.

The proof is already around in Sydney: have a look at the Metro Light Rail. This is a single line that goes meandering through Syneys inner west, from Central to Lilyfield. It's privately owned, though, so two things have happened. Firstly, the ticket for the light rail are separated: people like me need to
