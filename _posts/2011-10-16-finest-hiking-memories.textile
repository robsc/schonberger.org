title: Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo - A broadway review.
---
A couple of years ago, my friend Jim and I went hiking in Utah and Arizona. This was undoubtable some of the finest hiking i've done in my life: we made an impromptu decision to walk to the bottom of the grand canyon, and back, and many other hikes through more water, mud, dirt, and whatnot that you could imagine. 

A few days ago I had a flashback to a moment, sitting around in the middle of an eastern Utah desert. A guy next to us, living out of a little ute, pulls out his tent-for-one, sets it up, and just plays guitar, to no one and for no one, under the sparkling stars.

There's a hell of a lot of freedom in that kind of thing. I wonder what someone is thinking when they embark on a lone road trip, like he clearly was. I imagine he'll write a memoir one day about that time in his life.
