title: What do Facebook Search results do?
---

p(meta). 09 March. At Home

I've noticed facebook popping up into search results; I don't understand what I'm meant to do with the weird profile pages: there's no really useful information on them; The only time I've found them is when I look up actors on say Underbelly, and hey presto, I get their facebook page instead of something that has really useful content, like imdb. It's really not so handy? And I don't want to know that they're friends with randoms. 

To give you an example, here is the page of <a href="http://www.facebook.com//people/Sam-Anderson/512350796">Sam Anderson</a>, an actor whos been on a few Australian TV Shows. Whats the point of this face book search result? What are you meant to do? Add him, even though you don't know him? Send him a message? 

I don't think this is going to last for too long. If they put some real content on that page, that would be awesome, but as it stands, all it does is make me unhappy: I want an imdb page, or a page on channel 9s website; Certainly not facebook: most people probably don't have any social contact with Sam. As it stands, to me, when I see this, I'm just annoyed.
