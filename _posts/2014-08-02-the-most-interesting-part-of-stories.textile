title: The most interesting part of any story you hear.
---
p(meta). August 2, Brooklyn.

We read a lot of stories. Hopefully, most of them are interesting - I guess that's why we read most of them, since the bad ones don't get circulated that often. Either way, often, the most interesting part of a story is often what we don't hear about.

I was struck by this when thinking about a book that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn_Davidson">Robyn Davidson</a> wrote about a trip across the west Australian desert on camels. I haven't read the book, but it's also been turned into a movie recently. This is all very nice - but the big part that's missing is the <i>why</i> of the whole thing; Why travel across the harsh australian desert? Why pack up from urbane Sydney and move to Alcie Springs, with no goals; I think it's more interesting than the story of a trip, but then again, I haven't read the book. 

In fiction, the best example is of Rosencratz and Guildenstern in <i>Hamlet</i>: They disappear off stage, with orders to be murdered. It was such a good mystery that Tom Stoppard decided to make a play out of it, to help us with the fantasy. 

I think this is usaully the most interesting part of any conversation. What people don't talk about. Look for the mysteries.
